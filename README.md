# devops-dashboard

A Web application for looking at what you have deployed in your various software environments.  You can use it to see the specific versions of each project which are deployed, and even compare the versions deployed in one environments.  No more wondering if a particular version has been deployed to staging or production anymore.  You can see it all with a glance.
